Team Name: Remote Students

it is an international group pf student working remotely in a research project, i is the zenodo link https://zenodo.org/record/4167268#.X53Te4hKjIV

Research Question:
Which kind of style of learning is effective to internalize the knowledge about preventing COVID19 infection?
Hypothesis:
To input public health knowledge (COVID19), Studying using media (watching documentary video) is more effective rather than studying with traditional approach (reading book/instruction)
Experiment design
At least 18 students will be evenly and randomly distributed in two groups, to measure their learning with two different types of teaching.

Group 1: Studying with digital media: video

Group 2 (Control): traditional way: reading instruction

The two groups must have the same information and must have the same time to develop the activity, in the end both groups will take the same exam and the level of learning will be evaluated by the correct answers they obtain.
